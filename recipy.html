  	<h1><Classic <em>Spaghetti</em> Recipy</h1>

  	<p id="intro"> Pasta in the West may have first been worked into long, thin forms in Sicily around the 12th century, as the Tabula Rogeriana of Muhammad al-Idrisi attested, reporting some traditions about the Sicilian kingdom. In the 5th century AD, it was known that pasta could be cooked through boiling. The popularity of spaghetti spread throughout Italy after the establishment of spaghetti factories in the 19th century, enabling the mass production of spaghetti for the Italian market.  In the United States around the end of the 19th century, spaghetti was offered in restaurants asSpaghetti Italienne (which likely consisted of noodles cooked past al dente, and a mild tomato sauce flavored with easily found spices and vegetables such as cloves, bay leaves, and garlic) and it was not until decades later that it came to be commonly prepared with oregano or basil.</p>
